<h3>Tesla.inc</h3>
<p >Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. 
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs),
stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, 
solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.</p>
<p>Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. 
Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. 
In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive
 officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, 
followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, 
the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. 
In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.
In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.</p>
<p>Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. 
In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so.
In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share.
Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.
As of March 2024, it is the world's most valuable automaker.
Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, 
stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, 
worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, 
safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, 
and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist 
technology and product release timelines.</p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.
They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.
 Eberhard said that he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", 
with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor".</p>
<p>Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. 
In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, 
including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, 
who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. 
Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla. J. B. 
Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.</p>
<p>A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, 
Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.</p>
<h3>Energy products</h3>
<p>Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation 
systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, 
commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing 
battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired 
in 2016. In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, 
an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 
megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.</p>
<p>Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar 
Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall 
(a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system)</p>
<p>For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, 
real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control. 
In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.
 For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, 
which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, 
discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.</p>
